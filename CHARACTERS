Okay, I should probably explain............

....this is sort of metafiction, and as such, there are definitely 'Character
Profiles' I should add to this """"game"""" of """The War's Head Inn""" ---

At the very least, there's like, four.  In the spirit of cheeze / hamming this
up a knotch (and so, at the very least, you know I'm kind of writing a weird
form of a screenplay here), here's some characters you MAY MEET AS BOTS IN THIS
INN!!!

- Darius Fell, proprietor
- "Autumn" / Ayo Tino The Gleamer, ???
- Mx Trafford 
- ???


Maybe having fictional characters in a metafiction with an actually serious
real-world implication is not the best idea....? or maybe it'll make this light
hypertext world a little more lively as people actually appear in the world.
Character profiles! How does one do them? Let's, etc, etc.. [references.]
